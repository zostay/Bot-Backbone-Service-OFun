        service         => 'OFun::CodeName',
        nouns_file      => 'nouns.txt',
        adjectives_file => adjectives.txt',
        db_dsn          => 'dbi:SQLite:codename.db',
    );

    dispatcher chatroom => as {

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Have you ever wanted to assign really horrible code names to your projects? Your
clients? Your coworkers? Well, now is your chance. Just put this little baby
into your bot config and let it assign code names to your heart's content.

To work, you must supply it with your own list of nouns and adjectives (not
included) and a database, which is used to store the code names that have been
assigned. The code names are assigned in a standard-ish way so they will be
reassigned the same way every time, so long as you continue using the same noun
and adjective list. The database is used to remember the code name's reversal
and also to keep the code names the same if you do choose to modify your word
lists for some reason (say to remove some NSFW word or to add an NSFW word you
forgot to add in the first place).

=head1 DISPATCHER

=head2 !codename

    !codename phrase
    !codename code name

This command is used to generate a new codename or to tell you what a code name
refers to. You don't need to quote your words or anything, just give it as short
or as long a phrase as you want named and it will respond.

    command '!codename' => given_parameters {
        parameter 'phrase' => ( match_original => qr/.+/ );

};

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 adjectives_file

=head2 nouns_file

These are files that provide adjectives and nouns to the service. The words
should be listed one-per-line in the file with no blanks. Extra whitespace on
either side of each word will be trimmed.

=head2 adjectives

=head2 nouns

These are arrays of the loaded word lists.

=cut

for my $part (qw( adjective noun )) {
    my $part_file = "${part}s_file";
    has $part_file => (
        is         => 'ro',
        isa        => 'Path::Class::File',
        required   => 1,
        coerce     => 1,

    );

    __PACKAGE__->meta->add_method("_build_${part}s" => sub {
        my $self = shift;
        my @words = map { chomp; s/\s+$//; s/^\s+//; $_ } read_file($self->$part_file);
        return \@words;
    });

    has "${part}s" => (
        is         => 'ro',
        isa        => 'ArrayRef[Str]',
        lazy_build => 1,
        traits     => [ 'Array' ],
        handles    => {
            "get_${part}"    => 'get',
            "${part}s_count" => 'count',
        },
    );
}

=head1 METHODS

=head2 load_schema

Creates the C<codenames> file. It uses DDL SQL that should be compatible with
SQLite and MySQL databases.

=cut

sub load_schema {
    my ($self, $conn) = @_;

    $conn->run(fixup => sub {
        $_->do(q[
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS codenames(
                name varchar(255),
                alias varchar(255),
                is_code_name integer,
                PRIMARY KEY (name)
            )
        ]);
    });
}

=head2 assign_codename

This implements the C<!codename> command.

=cut

sub assign_codename {
    my ($self, $message) = @_;

    my $phrase = lc $message->parameters->{phrase};
    $phrase =~ s/^\s+//;
    $phrase =~ s/\s+$//;
    $phrase =~ s/\s+/ /g;

    my $alias = $self->find_key($phrase);
    if (defined $alias) {
        return $alias;
    }

    my $code_name = $self->generate_code_name($phrase);
    if ($code_name) {
        $self->store_key($code_name => $phrase, 1);
        $self->store_key($phrase => $code_name, 0);

        return $code_name;
    }
    else {
        return "Too many duplicates. Can't come up with a code name for that. Maybe you need to expand your adjectives or nouns list.";
    }
}

=head2 generate_code_name

  my $codename = $self->generate_code_name($phrase);

Given a string, it returns a new code name for that string.

=cut

sub generate_code_name {
    my ($self, $phrase) = @_;
    my $try_phrase = $phrase;

    my $max_tries = 5;
    TRY: while ($max_tries >= 0) {
        my $inv_phrase = reverse $try_phrase;

        my $raw_adj_index  = reduce { $a ^ $b } unpack "L*", sha1($try_phrase);
        my $raw_noun_index = reduce { $a ^ $b } unpack "L*", sha1($inv_phrase);

        my $adj_index  = $raw_adj_index  % $self->adjectives_count;
        my $noun_index = $raw_noun_index % $self->nouns_count;

        my $adjective = $self->get_adjective($adj_index);
        my $noun      = $self->get_noun($noun_index);
        my $code_name = join ' ', $adjective, $noun;

        # Duplicate check
        my $pair = $self->find_key($code_name);
        if ($pair) {
            $try_phrase = $try_phrase . '\0' . $phrase;
            $max_tries--;
            next TRY;
        }

        return $code_name;
    } 

    return;
}

=head2 find_key

  my $alias = $self->find_key($key);

Given a code name or a phrase that has been assigned a code name, it returns the
alias (i.e., the original phrase for code names and the code name assigned for
phrases). If that's not a stored alias, it returns undef.

=cut

sub find_key {
    my ($self, $key) = @_;

    my ($alias) = $self->db_conn->run(fixup => sub {
        my $sth = $_->prepare(q[
            SELECT alias
            FROM codenames
            WHERE name = ?
        ]);
        $sth->execute($key);
        $sth->fetchrow_array;
    });

    return $alias;
}

=head2 store_key

  $self->find_key($key, $alias, $is_code_name);

Stores a key/alias pair. When a code name is generated, it will be stored twice,
once to point the code name to the phrase and once to point the phrase back to
the code name. The C<$is_code_name> flag is used to indicate whether the C<$key>
is a code name or a phrase in this call. This flag is not used for anything
right now, but might be used for something in the future and is used to at least
allow you to discern which is the code name and which is not.

=cut

sub store_key {
    my ($self, $key, $alias, $iscn) = @_;

    $self->db_conn->run(fixup => sub {
        $_->do(q[
            INSERT INTO codenames(name, alias, is_code_name)
            VALUES (?, ?, ?)
        ], undef, $key, $alias, $iscn);
    });
}

=head2 initialize

No op.

=cut

sub initialize { }
