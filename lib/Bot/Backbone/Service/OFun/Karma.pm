=head1 DESCRIPTION

A common idiom in group chat (at least among tech geeks) is to use ++ and -- to show appreciation and derision. Now, you can have a bot that tracks that. It will show you a best ten list, a worst ten list, and the score of any particular word or phrase. 

You can also provide aliases, just in case a particular thing is referred to in more than one way and you want to track those scores together. The scores are still tracked for the original words, but tallied together while aliased. This way, if someone creates a bad or false alias, you can unalias it later without losing how things were scored in the meantime.

=head1 DISPATCHER

=head2 !score

    !score thing
    !score

With an argument, this command reports the score for it. Without an argument, it shows the best ten list, just like C<!best>.

=head2 !best

This command takes no arguments and shows the best ten list.

=head2 !worst

This command takes no argumenst and shows the worst ten list.

=head2 !score_alias

    !score_alias this that
    !score_alias this

With two arguments, this command will establish an alias from one word or phrase to another. You need to make sure to quote your phrases if they contain more than one word. Note that when it creates the alias, it will remove that word from either side of any other alias. Aliases cannot be chained.

If only a single argument is given (again, make sure you quote your phrases), it will report if there are any score aliases to or from that word or phrase.

=head2 !score_unalias

    !score_unalias this

This will delete any alias from this to something else.

=head2 Other Conversation

Finally, any other conversation is monitored to see if it contains ++ or -- notation. Anytime a word or quoted phrase contains a ++ or -- at the end of it, the score for that word or phrase will be incremented or decremented (respectively).

=head2 load_schema
